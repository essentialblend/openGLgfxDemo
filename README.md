In this project for one of my courseworks, the main personal goal was to use core (non ray-tracing) techniques to  achieve as much visual fidelity as possible. I implement various graphics techniques ranging from:

- OpenGL fundamentals (buffer/array objects, shaders, instanced rendering, textures) following best practices as provided   by Khronos, wherever possible.
- Writing an .obj parser and working with models.
- Blinn-Phong lighting, and shadow mapping for point, spot, and directional sources.
- Various maps (normals, emissive) etc.
- Sky cubemaps with day-night cycles, and accompanying light properties resulting in a more vibrant realistic atmosphere.
- Screen-space post process effects i.e., god-rays, fog.
- Procgen with FBM and Poisson Disk sampling.
