Graphics Project in OpenGL.

In this project for one of my courseworks, I implement various graphics techniques ranging from:

- OpenGL fundamentals (buffer/array objects, shaders, instanced rendering, textures).
- Writing an .obj parser.
- Blinn-Phong lighting, and shadow mapping for point, spot, and directional sources.
- Various maps (normals, emissive) etc.
- Sky cubemaps with day-night cycles.
- Screen-space post process effects i.e., god-rays, fog.
- Procgen with FBM and Poisson Disk sampling.
